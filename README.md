# GridWave

## Concept
GridWave is a small webgl experiment with three.js, whose objective was to achieve interactive opacity through an organic geometry.
It includes vertex and pixel shaders written in GLSL, and it was co-developed with Yiannis Gravezas.

## Tech
Gridwave was developed in HTML/CSS/Javascript using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) framework and GLSL for the shaders.
